# TORNADOES
A Method for chromatin domain partitioning based on hypergraph clustering
# Before processing
Before running code, please use the method CASPIAN to generate TAD files with different resolutions. CASPIAN code can be accessed fromhttps://gitee.com/ghaiyan/caspian.

# step1: generate the hypergraph and classfy TADs into different types:two, three or four
running the code in the file of hypergraph.ipynb using the jupter notebook.

# step2: evalute
running the code in the file of Landmark position.ipynb
